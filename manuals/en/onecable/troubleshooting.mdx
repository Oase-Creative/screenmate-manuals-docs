## Troubleshooting: MacBook

Screen not working on your MacBook? This is often due to security settings in MacOS (Screen Recording permissions) needed for the driver.

**Follow these steps:**

### Step 1: Check Notification
You might see a "Screen Recording" notification.

### Step 2: Privacy & Security
Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording**.

### Step 3: Grant Permission
Ensure the driver (often named "DisplayLink" or "SMI USB Display") is checked. Restart your MacBook after this.
