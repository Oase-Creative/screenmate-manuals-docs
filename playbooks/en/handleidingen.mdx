## Overview

This playbook describes the complete internal process for developing **manuals** at Oase Creative.
We deliver two types of manuals:
1. **Graphic manuals (PDF / print / design)**
2. **Online manuals (Mintlify documentation)**

Both journeys start with a complete intake and collection of all required assets.

## Part 1: Graphic Manuals (PDF / Design)

### Step 1: Intake Form via Slack

Clients fill out a comprehensive form. The form must be complete before we start.

### Form must contain:
- Title of the manual
- Target audience
- Purpose of the manual
- Expected length in pages
- Branding (logos, colors, typography)
- Example manuals / moodboards
- Images, icons, or diagrams
- Texts or raw content
- Required languages
- Form of delivery (PDF / print-ready / digital)

### Actions:
1. Check form
2. Request missing assets
3. Save everything in Google Drive
4. Slack update: intake complete

<Warning>
Incomplete intake = no start of the project.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Design Phase

When all assets are complete, the designer starts with the design.

### Designer works on:
- Structure & layout
- Page layout
- Iconography & visuals
- Typography
- Color usage
- Diagrams, schemas, tables
- Branding according to client identity

### Output:
- First design version (PDF)

## Step 3: First Version to Client

Project manager sends to client:
- PDF sample
- Request to provide revisions bundled

### Revisions:
- 1 revision round included
- Extra revisions → additional work

## Step 4: Process Revisions

Designer processes revisions:
- Visual improvements
- Content adjustments
- Corrections on icons / visuals

## Step 5: Final Delivery (Graphic)

### Delivery contains:
- Final PDF
- Optionally: source files
- Drive folder with all assets
- Any multilingual versions

Extra languages can be built in faster through our internal automations.

## Part 2: Online Manuals (Mintlify)

### Step 1: Technical Setup

We build online documentation via:
- **GitHub** (structure & version control)
- **Mintlify** (UI, hosting & documentation management)

### Actions:
1. Set up new GitHub repository
2. Create Mintlify account for client
3. Activate GitHub ↔ Mintlify connection
4. Start Slack channel for the project

## Step 2: Discovery Conversation with Client

A consultation in which is determined:
- Purpose of the documentation
- Structure (chapters, sections, sidebar)
- Target audiences (customers, users, developers)
- Branding for Mintlify
- Language/languages
- Integrations (API docs, changelog, guides)
- Automations (AI search, auto-indexing)

## Step 3: Collect Content & Assets

Together with the client, we collect:
- Texts
- Screenshots
- Videos
- Diagrams
- Tables
- Function descriptions
- Tutorials & step plans
- FAQs

Everything is saved in Drive and GitHub.

## Step 4: Build Work in Mintlify

### Tasks:
- Structure sidebar
- Build pages in Markdown
- Incorporate screenshots
- Embed videos
- Add code snippets (if developer docs)
- Set up multilingual structure:
- `/nl/...`
- `/en/...`
- `/de/...`

Mintlify supports multilingual duplication, making this efficient.

## Step 5: Publish First Version

The first version is placed on a Mintlify preview environment.

### Actions:
- Slack update with preview URL
- Walkthrough call with client

## Step 6: Process Revisions

Client provides one bundled revision list.

### Revisions contain:
- Text corrections
- Structure adjustments
- New screenshots
- New sections
- Design corrections

1 revision round included.

## Step 7: Final Delivery (Mintlify)

### Delivery contains:
- Live Mintlify documentation
- GitHub repository fully set up
- Branding & navigation complete
- Multilingual versions (if applicable)
- Video explanation for management (optional)

## Best Practices

### For graphic manuals:
- Use many visuals
- Work modularly per section
- Use consistent icons
- Keep text compact and scannable
- Bundle all feedback in one document

### For Mintlify:
- Keep pages short and modular
- Use clear file names
- Always document with examples
- Use AI Search & metadata
- Make use of multilingual duplication
