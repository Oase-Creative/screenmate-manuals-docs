## Overview

This playbook describes the complete internal process for designing packaging (Packaging Design) at Oase Creative. This service is relatively simple in workflow, but requires high accuracy and consistent quality control. The design must fully align with the client's branding and be correctly formatted for printing.

## Step 1: Receive Intake Form via Slack

When a client fills out the Packaging Design form, it arrives in Slack.
The project manager opens the form and checks all entered information.

### What the intake form must contain:
- Type of packaging (box, sleeve, pouch, label, insert)
- Dimensions or provided **dielines** (cutting template)
- Branding material (logos, colors, typography)
- Texts that go on the packaging
- Placement of warnings / icons / legal information
- Inspiration examples or moodboards
- Purpose of the product / target audience
- Any product specifications

<Warning>
If **no dieline** is provided, the process stops until it is delivered by the client or printer.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Check Assets

All provided files must be checked before design starts.

### Checklist for asset check:
- Dieline (PDF / AI) present and technically correct?
- Logos in vector format? (SVG / EPS / AI)
- Color codes available?
- Typography available?
- Text provided in editable form?
- Photos in sufficient resolution?
- References clear?
- Are there legal requirements for the product?

<Tip>
Tip: Create an internal folder "/Input from client" in Google Drive to collect everything.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Start Design

When all input is present, the designer can begin.

### Design workflow:
1. Open dieline in Illustrator
2. Set up layer structure neatly (Template / Artwork / Text / Icons)
3. Apply branding (color, fonts, logos)
4. Determine composition based on:
- USPs
- Product information
- Front panel / backside / side panels
5. Place legal texts (if applicable)
6. Respect safety margins (bleed / cutting area)
7. Format first concept

### Technical guidelines:
- Work **100% in vector** where possible
- Use CMYK for print formatting
- Set cut lines and fold lines correctly
- Pay attention to readability (minimum font size)
- Ensure correct bleed (3–5 mm)

## Step 4: First Delivery to Client

When the first design is ready, the project manager delivers the concept to the client.

### Delivery contains:
- Sample PDF (screen proof)
- A mock-up (optional but recommended)
- Short explanation: colors, fonts, composition, rationale

### File names:
```
[CLIENTNAME]_Packaging_Concept_v1.pdf
[CLIENTNAME]_Mockup_v1.jpg
```

## Step 5: Revision Rounds

Each packaging assignment includes standard **2 revision rounds**.

### Revision process:
1. Client provides feedback
2. Designer processes revisions
3. Update is sent to client again
4. Upon approval → proceed to finalization
5. With extra revisions → discuss additional work

### Revision checklist:
- Are all changes consistently implemented?
- Have colors and fonts remained unchanged?
- Has the composition improved, not worsened?
- Are texts still correct after moving?

## Step 6: Final Delivery (Print Files)

When the client approves, the print files are prepared.

### Best practice print formatting:
- Everything in CMYK
- Logos and text: vector
- Raster photos minimum 300 DPI
- Cut lines on separate layer
- Bleed correct
- No hidden objects
- Check overprint settings
- Fonts outlined / or attached
- Final check for spelling errors

### Files that are delivered:
- **Print PDF** (Press Ready)
- **Open file (.AI)**
- **Mock-up JPEG/PNG**
- **Copy of all assets in final folder**

### File structure:
```
/Packaging Design
/Input
/Concept
/Revisions
/Final
- Print Ready PDF
- AI Source File
- Mockups
```

## Step 7: Upload to Google Drive

Upload the final files in the project folder:
- /Input
- /Concept
- /Revisions
- /Final
- /Mockups

### Slack update:
"Packaging design for [Client Name] is completed. Final files are in Google Drive."

## Best Practices

- Always use vector logos — never scale screenshots or PNGs.
- Consider fold lines and overlaps.
- Check products in advance (weight, shape, position of labels).
- Use multiple mock-ups (flat, 3D, in-hand).
- Communicate clearly when information is missing.
- Use color management profiles for CMYK.
- Always make an internal preflight for printing.

## Workflow Summary

1. Intake form via Slack
2. Check assets
3. Design phase
4. Deliver first concept
5. Revisions (max 2 rounds)
6. Export final print files
7. Upload to Drive
8. Final delivery to client

> Important: Communicate each step in Slack so the team stays informed.
