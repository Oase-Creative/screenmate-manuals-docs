## Overview

This playbook describes the complete internal process for designing and developing a **Shopify store** at Oase Creative.
Execution is in collaboration with our fixed Shopify developer:
**Daniel Al Seffar – daniel@oasecreative.nl**
(Active within our internal Slack environment)

The process includes intake, planning, setup, design, development, revisions, delivery, and internal communication.

## Step 1: Intake Form via Slack

Clients fill out a **comprehensive Shopify form**.
This form must be **100% complete** before we start.

### The form must contain:
- Company name + description
- Collections structure
- Product information
- Branding (logo, colors, typography)
- Example webshops
- Functionality wishes
- SEO data (titles, texts)
- Photos / assets
- Apps that should be used
- Domain name + any email setups
- Legal pages (privacy, return, terms and conditions)

### Project manager actions:
1. Review form and check for completeness.
2. Check if all assets are present.
3. If intake incomplete → request client to provide information.
4. Save intake + assets in Google Drive project folder.
5. Post Slack update: "Shopify intake complete – ready for planning."

<Warning>
Without complete intake and assets, we do NOT start.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create Project in Slack + Internal Communication

### Actions:
- Project manager creates a new Slack project channel.
- Add:
- **Daniel Al Seffar**
- Involved designers
- Project manager
- Any copywriters / photographers
- Pin:
- Intake form
- Drive link
- Deadlines
- Checklist

Daniel uses Slack as the main communication channel during development.

## Step 3: Create Shopify Environment (via our development environment)

We emphatically instruct the client:
**"Do NOT create your own Shopify environment."**

Why:
- We use an official Shopify Partner environment
- We receive commission via our partner environment
- We have full control over the development process

### Actions:
1. Project manager creates new **development store** via Shopify Partner Dashboard.
2. Access is granted to Daniel Al Seffar.
3. Basic configuration is set up:
- Domain placeholder
- Template installation
- Install basic apps
- Duplicate theme for safety

## Step 4: Set Up Base Theme + Structure

Daniel sets up the base structure of the webshop:

### Tasks:
- Create collections
- Set up navigation structure
- Configure footer menu
- Create pages:
- Home
- About us
- Contact
- FAQ
- Legal pages
- Set fonts & colors according to branding
- Insert placeholder images
- Configure apps (reviews, bundles, upsells, email automation)

## Step 5: Process Intake Information

All information from the form is systematically processed:

### Contains:
- Upload products
- Variants & barcodes
- Add SEO titles & descriptions
- Fill collections
- Optimize photos
- Process copywriting (if provided)
- Fully build homepage layout

## Step 6: Develop First Version (within 2 weeks)

Within **2 weeks**, Daniel delivers a complete first version.

### First version contains:
- Complete visual branding
- Homepage fully worked out
- Product pages
- Collection pages
- All content pages
- Apps installed
- First checkout test

### Project manager actions:
- Test first version
- Collect feedback
- Schedule date for revision call

## Step 7: Revision Call & Video Recording

### Actions:
1. Schedule video call with client.
2. Daniel records a **video explanation** during or after the call:
- Explanation of the webshop
- Explanation per page
- Instructions about functionalities
3. Video is sent to client as reference material.

> 🎥 This video minimizes revisions and prevents miscommunication.

## Step 8: Collect & Process Revisions

### Process:
- Client sends revision list
- Project manager translates revisions in Slack to Daniel
- Daniel processes these revisions
- Designers support with visuals if needed
- Slack is continuously updated with progress

### Possible revisions:
- Color or layout changes
- Content updates
- Function adjustments
- App tweaks

## Step 9: Finalization (within 20 working days)

The webshop is fully completed within **20 working days**.

### Final checks:
- Test checkout
- Test apps
- Review navigation
- Mobile optimization
- Set SEO basics correctly
- Optimize images

## Step 10: Deliver to Client

### Delivery package consists of:
- Access to Shopify store
- Video explanation (previously recorded)
- Documentation (optional)
- Drive folder with all assets
- Instructions about:
- Order management
- Product management
- Collection management
- Apps

> The client can make adjustments independently after delivery.

## Step 11: Internal Closure

### Actions:
- Post Slack update: project completed
- Daniel and PM document learnings
- Finalize Drive folder
- Register any upsell opportunities (CRO, email flows, advertisements, product photography etc.)

## Best Practices

- Intake must be complete: incomplete intake = delay.
- Always work via our development environment (no own Shopify from client).
- Monitor deadlines:
- **2 weeks → first version**
- **20 days → final delivery**
- Use Loom/videos to limit revisions.
- Mobile-first thinking: >60% of visitors use mobile.
- Keep all communication transparent in Slack.
