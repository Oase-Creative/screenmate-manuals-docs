## Overview

This playbook describes the complete internal process for creating a Brandbook at Oase Creative. The Brandbook forms the visual and strategic foundation of a brand. Because not every client books a full Brand Discovery, there are **two entry routes**:
- **Route A — With Brand Discovery**
- **Route B — Without Brand Discovery (only intake form via Slack)**

Both routes ultimately lead to the same Brandbook process, but with different preparation and information flows.

## Step 1: Determine Entry Route

### Route A — Brand Discovery has been executed

Use the following documents:
- Stylescapes (approved)
- Discovery report
- Target audience analysis
- Brand personality
- Tone of voice findings
- Strategic insights

### Checkpoints
- Are all stylescapes approved?
- Are all strategic components filled in?
- Have revisions from the presentation been processed?
- Are all files accessible in Google Drive?

### Route B — No Brand Discovery (only intake form)

For some assignments, the client only provides the submitted **Branding Intake Form**.
This form arrives via Slack.

### Step 1B.1 — Check the intake form

Check if the form contains the following information:
- Company name + short description
- Target audience
- Competitors
- Color preferences
- Style preferences (modern, minimalist, playful, luxury...)
- Tone of voice preference
- Uploads (logos, moodboards, references)

<Warning>
Missing crucial information?
Then send a follow-up email with additional questions.
</Warning>

### Step 1B.2 — Mini-Discovery Questionnaire (for limited information)

Use this questionnaire in a short video call or via email:

### Mini-Discovery questionnaire
1. Describe your brand in 3 words.
2. What should the customer feel when seeing your brand?
3. What should the brand **definitely not** convey?
4. What makes your product or service unique?
5. What is your most important message?
6. Name examples of styles you find beautiful.
7. Are there brands you draw inspiration from?
8. What will you mainly use the branding for? (print, packaging, social, website)

### Purpose of the mini-discovery
- Determine direction without a full session
- Align expectations
- Concretize visual preferences

## Step 2: Internal & External Planning

### Communication to client
Send an email with:
- Start confirmation Brandbook journey
- Planning + revision moments
- Overview of required files (if not yet received)
- Expectations regarding delivery formats

### Internal planning
- Sprint 1 — Logo concepts
- Sprint 2 — Visual identity
- Sprint 3 — Brandbook structure
- Sprint 4 — Revision rounds
- Sprint 5 — Final delivery

## Step 3: Logo Development

### Logo Design Steps
1. Analysis (Discovery / Intake Form)
2. Create moodboard(s)
3. Sketch phase (3–5 directions)
4. Digital execution in Illustrator
5. Determine color systems
6. Logo grid and proportions
7. Build variations:
- Primary logo
- Secondary logo
- Icon
- Horizontal / vertical
8. Monochrome versions

### Delivery formats
- .AI
- .EPS
- .SVG
- .PNG (transparent)
- .JPG

## Step 4: Typography

### Components to determine
- Title typography
- Body typography
- Accent typography
- Use of capitals
- Weight & style (Regular, Bold, Light, Italic)
- Guidelines for letter-spacing and line-height

### Test moments
- Readability on mobile
- Readability on desktop
- Readability on print

## Step 5: Color Palette

### Structure of the color palette
- 1 primary color
- 2 secondary colors
- 3–5 additional tints
- Dark & light variants

### Deliverables
- HEX
- RGB
- CMYK
- Color names

<Tip>
Tip: Test contrast for accessibility according to WCAG guidelines.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Visual Style

### Part of the visual identity:
- Photo style (studio, lifestyle, warm, cool, 3D, etc.)
- Iconography
- Illustration style
- Patterns & shapes
- Atmosphere & texture
- Layout grids

<Warning>
Ensure the visual style consistently aligns with the chosen direction in the intake form or Discovery document.
</Warning>

## Step 7: Tone of Voice

### Creating the ToV
- Core values → translate to tone
- Words that are used
- Words that are not used
- Writing style (formal, informal, playful, business)
- Spoken vs. written language

### Tone of voice examples
- Example sentences
- Social media captions
- Website headings
- Advertisement texts

## Step 8: Brandbook Structure

### Standard Table of Contents
1. Introduction
2. Logo + guidelines
3. Color palette
4. Typography
5. Photography guidelines
6. Iconography
7. Layout & grid systems
8. Tone of voice
9. Examples & applications

### Logo section must contain:

### Colors section must contain:
- Primary palette
- Secondary palette
- Tertiary colors
- Color examples in use

## Step 9: Present to Client

### What you present

- Logos + variants
- Color palette
- Typography
- Tone of voice
- Visual style
- Mockups

### During the meeting
- Note feedback directly
- Check if expectations align
- Plan revision round(s)

## Step 10: Process Revisions

### Revision checklist
- Is all feedback completely processed?
- Did an alternative direction need to be created?
- Do stylescapes need to be adjusted?
- Is everything updated in the Brandbook document?
- Is the team informed via Slack?

<Warning>
Maximum 2 revision rounds unless otherwise agreed.
</Warning>

## Step 11: Final Delivery

### Delivery folder contains:
- All logos in all formats
- Brandbook (PDF + Figma link)
