## Overview

This playbook describes the complete internal process for **Product Photography** at Oase Creative.
The focus is on:
- Capturing all required images for all USPs of the product
- A smooth handover to the editor via Slack
- Consistent post-production (isolating, retouching, removing reflections)
- Correct storage in Google Drive
- Delivery to the client without revision rounds

## Step 1: Intake Form & USP List

Each product photography assignment starts with a completed **product photography form**.

### The form ideally contains:
- Product name + short description
- Number of products
- Type of photography:
- Packshots (isolated)
- Detail shots
- Lifestyle (optional)
- Purpose of the photos (bol.com, website, social, packaging, etc.)
- **List of USPs** (Unique Selling Points)
- Associated designs or mock-ups that need images
- Wish for format / ratio (1:1, 4:5, 16:9, etc.)
- Deadline and delivery preference

<Warning>
Important: If the USP list is missing, this must first be requested. All important USPs must be visually represented.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Planning & Preparation Product Shoot

The workflow is similar to Brand Fotoshoot, but is product-focused and more technical.

### Internal actions:
- Project manager reviews the form.
- Checks if all products are delivered on time.
- Plans date for the shoot (studio or on location).
- Assigns a photographer with experience in product photography.

### Preparation for the photographer:
- Create shotlist based on:
- USP list
- Platforms the photos will be used for (bol.com, Amazon, Shopify, etc.)
- Determine:
- Background (white, gray, colored, surface)
- Lighting setup (shadow direction, soft/hard light)
- Any props

## Step 3: Execute Product Shoot

### During the shoot:
- Check products for damage, dust, and fingerprints.
- Take photos according to the shotlist:
- Main image (hero shot)
- All USP-specific images
- Detail shots (close-ups of features, textures, buttons, etc.)
- Make extra variants if needed (angle, perspective, light).

<Tip>
**Important:** For each USP from the form, there must be at least one clear photo that visually supports that USP.
</Tip>

### Immediately after the shoot:
- Quickly check for:
- Blurry images
- Technical errors (noise, flares, misfocus)
- Make a backup (local and/or external SSD).

## Step 4: Upload to Editing Channel in Slack

After the shoot:
1. Photographer exports or copies all RAW/ORF/CR2/CR3 files to a temporary folder.
2. Photographer uploads the photos (or an overview) to the **editing channel in Slack**.

### Slack message contains:
- Client name + project name
- Short explanation of type of shoot
- Link to Google Drive folder with RAWs
- Important instructions for the editor:
- Make all images isolated
- Specific points of attention (e.g., labels, reflections, dust, color correction)

## Step 5: Editing & Post-Production by Editor

The editor is responsible for all **post-production**.

### Standard edits:
- Isolating (background removal)
- Retouching:
- Remove dust, scratches, stains
- Correct imperfections
- Reduce or remove reflections
- Color correction (realistic representation)
- Optimize white balance and contrast
- Crop to correct ratios (depending on platform)

<Warning>
Quality standard: Products must look **realistic but perfectly cared for** — no excessive smoothing or unnatural edits.
</Warning>

### Export formats:
- **JPG** for web (optimized, correct resolution)
- **PNG** as isolated images (if needed)
- Optionally **TIFF** for printing (on request)

## Step 6: Upload to Google Drive

After post-production, the editor uploads all images to the correct folder in Google Drive.

### Structure:
```
/Product Photography
/[Client Name]
/RAW
/Edited
/Export
```

### Image categories:
- **RAW** – unedited files from the camera
- **Edited** – fully retouched images in high quality
- **Export** – versions optimized per channel (bol.com, website, social, etc.)

## Step 7: Deliver to Client

The project manager:
1. Spot checks the edited images.
2. Checks if all USPs are visually covered.
3. Sends the Drive link to the client.

### Delivery email contains:
- Link to the Google Drive folder
- Short explanation:
- Which folders contain what (RAW / Edited / Export)
- Any recommended files for specific platforms
- Note: **There are no revision rounds on product photography included.**

<Warning>
Communication must make clear that post-production is included, but that no further retouching rounds or reshoots fall within the standard service, unless explicitly agreed as additional work.
</Warning>

## Revision Policy

For **product photography**:
- **No revisions** on the photos themselves within the standard service.
- If a shot is truly missing because it was accidentally not taken (and was in the shotlist/USP list), that is an internal point and must be assessed per project.
- Aesthetic preferences afterward ("we would prefer something slightly different") fall outside the standard scope.

## Best Practices

- Ensure all USPs from the form can be 1-on-1 linked to photos.
- Over-communicate rather than under-communicate in the editing channel.
- Always make a few extra variants during the shoot; that helps the editor with selection and cutting room.
- Consistent light = consistent brand image.
- Check before upload if file names are logical (e.g., product name + USP + number).

## Workflow Summary

1. Receive intake form + USP list
2. Plan shoot & create shotlist
3. Execute product shoot
4. Upload RAW images to editing channel in Slack
5. Editor: isolate, retouch, remove reflections
6. Upload Edited + RAW to Google Drive in correct structure
7. Project manager checks & shares link with client
8. No revisions (unless separately agreed as additional work)

> Important: All communication regarding editing and delivery goes via Slack and is centrally secured in the project folder.
