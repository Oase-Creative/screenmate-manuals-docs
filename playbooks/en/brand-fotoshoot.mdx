## Overview

This playbook describes the complete internal process for planning, executing, and delivering a Brand Fotoshoot at Oase Creative. It includes all steps from the moment the intake form arrives via Slack, to post-production, storage, and final delivery to the client.
There are multiple variants of this service:
- Studio photoshoot
- On location
- With or without models
- Commercial / lifestyle / product photography

The workflow below is applicable to all variants.

## Step 1: Receive Intake Form via Slack

When the client fills out the Brand Fotoshoot form, it automatically arrives in the appropriate Slack channel (#intakes, #projects, or assigned channel).

### What's in the intake form:
- Type of shoot (studio, lifestyle, product, outdoor)
- Location preference(s)
- Purpose of the shoot (branding, website, commercial, packaging)
- Any moodboards
- Required models (yes/no)
- Products to be photographed
- Deadline / desired delivery date
- Client contact information

### Actions:
1. Project manager reads the form completely.
2. Saves the intake form in the appropriate Google Drive project folder.
3. Posts a message in Slack to select a photographer.

## Step 2: Internal Team Selection

### Goal:
With the team, determine who is the best photographer / creative for:
- the type of shoot
- the desired style
- the location
- the planning

### Actions:
- Project manager shares the form in Slack.
- Team looks at who is available and best fits the style.
- Photographer is assigned.
- Any makeup artist, model, or assistant is added.

<Tip>
Use internal reference portfolios to determine which photographer best matches the client's style.

## Step 3: Preparation and Planning

### 3A. Schedule shoot date
- Contact client (always via ...@oasecreative.nl).
- Confirm date + time.
- Confirm location (at client, in studio, or external).

### 3B. Arrange location & models
**If applicable:**
- Rent location or confirm permission.
- Book model(s) via partner agency.
- Make travel planning (travel costs + parking costs).

### 3C. Create shotlist
Shotlist is based on:
- Intake form
- Moodboards
- Deliverables (website banners, social, packaging compositions etc.)

### Example shotlist:
- Packshots (product isolated)
- Lifestyle atmosphere photos
- Detail close-ups
- Product + model
- Product in use
- Branding atmosphere images

<Warning>
Important: have shotlist approved by client in advance.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Prepare Gear & Technique

The project manager checks if all required items are available for the photographer.

### Gear checklist:
- Camera bodies (2 recommended)
- Lenses (24-70mm, 50mm, 85mm, macro)
- SD cards
- Spare batteries
- Battery chargers
- Flashes or continuous lights
- Softboxes & diffusers
- Reflectors
- Tripod
- Tethering cables
- Background paper or backstage drops
- Cleaning cloths / air blower
- Power banks / extension cords

<Tip>
Tip: Gear is always tested the day before the shoot.

## Step 5: Execute Brand Fotoshoot

### On location:
- Arrive 10–20 minutes early.
- Explore location and determine lighting setup.
- Prepare shotlist on phone / iPad.
- Briefly walk client through planning.

### During the shoot:
- Take photos according to shotlist.
- Variation in angles, lighting, and compositions.
- Show client sample photos during the shoot.
- Take extra photos if client wants options.

### After the shoot:
- Check all photos before leaving.
- Make backup on laptop or SSD.

## Step 6: Post-Production

The photographer is responsible for:
- Selecting best images
- Retouching
- Making corrections (exposure, color, contrast)
- Cleaning (removing dust, scratches, imperfections)
- Exporting in correct formats:
- Social media (JPG / 3000px wide)
- Website (optimized)
- Print (300 DPI)
- Isolated PNG (if needed)

<Tip>
Oase standard edits are **incl. post-production**, as stated in the leaflet.
</Tip>

## Step 7: Upload to Google Drive

The photographer uploads:

### 1. Unedited photos
- Folder: **RAW / Unedited**

### 2. Edited photos
- Folder: **Final / Edited**

### 3. Extra files
- Isolated PNGs
- Crops for website banners
- Variations per format

### File structure:
```
/Projects
/[Client Name]
/Brand Fotoshoot
/RAW
/Preview
/Final
/Export
```

## Step 8: Deliver to Client

### Project manager sends:
- Link to Google Drive
- Explanation of folder structure
- Optional summary of shoot
- Any notes for web team (if website follows)

### Delivery formats:
- JPG (edited images)
- PNG (isolated if agreed)
- Any TIFF for print
- All RAW files optional or on request

## Best Practices

- Always ensure double backups.
- Pay attention to consistency in color profiles (sRGB for web).
- Be flexible on location and adjust lighting to conditions.
- Make extra variations if client is uncertain.
- Document settings so images are reproducible.
- Communicate proactively via Slack with the project team.
