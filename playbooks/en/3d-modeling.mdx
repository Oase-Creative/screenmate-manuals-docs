## Overview

This playbook describes the complete internal process for delivering 3D modeling and 3D rendering within Oase Creative.
This service is always executed externally by our fixed partner **Zero Point Visuals** in Portugal (Ortegal).
We handle the intake, quality control, communication, and delivery.
There are **two possible entry routes**:
- **Option 1 — Modeling from an existing CAD file**
- **Option 2 — Modeling from scratch (photos + dimensions needed)**
Both routes are submitted by the client via Slack through the form.

## Step 1: Receive Intake Form via Slack

When the client fills out the 3D Modeling form, it automatically arrives in Slack.

### The form must contain:
- Product type
- Purpose of the 3D modeling (rendering, animation, product shots, packaging)
- Option chosen by client:
- **CAD file available**
- **No CAD → modeling from scratch needed**
- Uploads:
- CAD file (if option 1)
- Product photos (if option 2)
- All dimensions (height, width, depth)
- Reference images or moodboards
- Material types (plastic, aluminum, matte, gloss, glass, texture)
- Colors or PMS codes
- Expected deadline

### Actions:
1. Project manager reads form.
2. Checks if all required files are present.
3. Saves the intake form + uploads in the Google Drive project folder.
4. Notifies in Slack that the project is being assigned to Zero Point Visuals.

<Warning>
No CAD file and no photos/dimensions available?
**Stop the process** → client must first provide complete input.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Determine Entry Route

### Option 1 — Modeling via CAD File

If the client provides a **STEP**, **STP**, **IGES**, **OBJ**, **GLB**, or **FBX** file.

### Checkpoints:
- Is the file opened and readable?
- Are all product components present?
- Are the dimensions correct?

<Tip>
Tip: Save a copy of the CAD file in the `/Input` folder.
</Tip>

### Option 2 — Modeling from Scratch

When the client has **no CAD file**.

### Required information:
- Minimum **8 product photos** (front, back, sides, top, and bottom)
- Detail photos of edges, textures, and materials
- Dimensions:
- Height
- Width
- Depth
- Thickness (if applicable)
- Additional information:
- Materials (metal, plastic, wood, etc.)
- Finish (matte, gloss, satin)
- Color codes

<Warning>
Without exact dimensions, Zero Point Visuals **cannot** model.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Outsource to Zero Point Visuals

When the information is complete, the project manager sends an assignment to our fixed external partner:

### Zero Point Visuals Contact Information:
- **Name:** Mario Rayford
- **Email:** mariorayford@zeropointvisuals.com
- **Phone/WhatsApp:** +351 924 447 132

### Instructions that must be sent:
- Project description
- Purpose of the model (stills, rendering, animation, packaging visuals)
- Entry route (CAD or Scratch)
- All input:
- CAD files / photos / dimensions
- Moodboards
- Material references
- Color codes
- Deadline and delivery requirements
- Number of renders needed
- Any required camera angles

### Working method:
- Mario confirms receipt
- Provides an estimate of delivery time
- Asks questions if input is missing

## Step 4: External Modeling & Rendering Process (Zero Point Visuals)

Zero Point Visuals executes the complete modeling and rendering process:

### Steps that happen externally:
1. Build 3D model (CAD or scratch)
2. Apply materials & textures
3. Lighting setup (HDRI, softbox, studio or environment)
4. Camera setups
5. Send render preview(s)
6. Process feedback
7. Export final renders in agreed formats

### File formats that are delivered:
- 3D model:
- .OBJ
- .FBX
- .GLB
- .BLEND (if desired)
- Final renders:
- PNG (transparent)
- JPG (optimized)
- TIFF (if print)

## Step 5: Receipt & Internal Quality Control

The project manager checks the delivered files:

### QC Checklist:
- Are the dimensions correct?
- Are materials correctly applied?
- Does the style match Oase Creative quality?
- Are renders sharp, professional, and error-free?
- Are there artifacts, noise, or lighting errors?
- Is the color representation correct?

<Tip>
When something is not correct → send feedback directly back to Zero Point Visuals.
</Tip>

## Step 6: Deliver to Client

When everything is approved:

### File structure (Google Drive):
```
/3D Modeling
/Input
/Model
/Preview
/Final Renders
/Export
```

### Delivery consists of:
- All final renders
- 3D model files
- Additional angles / compositions if agreed
- Any mock-ups where the 3D model is incorporated

### Communication to client:
- Link to Google Drive
- Brief explanation of what has been delivered
- Any recommendations for future use

## Revision Policy

Standard 3D modeling at Oase includes:
- **1 revision round included** (external)
- More revisions = **additional work**, depending on complexity

<Warning>
Revisions can take extra days depending on Zero Point Visuals' workload.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- Always provide **as many references as possible** for modeling from scratch.
- Keep all communication with Mario in Slack or email.
- Plan more generous deadlines for complex products.
- Take into account time difference Portugal–Netherlands.
- Always ask for "raw renders" if you want to do post-processing yourself.
- Save all files twice (Drive + local) for safety.

## Workflow Summary

1. Intake via Slack
2. Determine entry route (CAD or Scratch)
3. Collect & check input
4. Outsource to Zero Point Visuals
5. External modeling & rendering
6. Internal quality control
7. Deliver to client
8. Process any revision

> Important: Communicate each step in Slack so the team is always informed.
