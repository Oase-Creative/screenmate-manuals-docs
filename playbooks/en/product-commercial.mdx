## Overview

This playbook describes the complete internal process for producing **Product Commercials (product videos)** at Oase Creative.
This service is executed in collaboration with external videographers, location scouts, and model agencies.
We standardly work with two videography partners:
- **Y. Genç** → for smaller productions (lower budget)
- **Boni Films** → for larger productions (higher budget)

### Contact information external partners:
- **Boni Films**

- Reachable via Slack (internal environment)

## Step 1: Product Received + Intake Form

When the product arrives with us and the intake form appears in Slack:

### Check if the intake form contains:

- Purpose of the video (website, social, advertisements, Amazon, etc.)
- Deadline
- Any style preferences
- Moodboards or example videos
- USP list of the product
- Any wishes for models
- Preferred location (studio or external location)

### Actions:
1. Project manager checks the form.
2. Product and intake are saved in Google Drive.
3. Slack update: product is received and ready for planning.

## Step 2: Choose Video Partner

Based on budget, assignment size, and complexity, the right partner is chosen:

### Option A — Small budget → **Y. Genç**

### Note:

## Step 10: Process Revisions

### Process:

## Step 11: Final Delivery
