## Overview

This playbook describes the complete process for creating product listings. Follow these steps carefully to ensure consistent and high-quality results.

## Package Options

Clients can choose from four different packages for their product listing:

| Package | Design | Product Photography | Lifestyle Photography | Model Shoot on Location |
|---------|:------:|:-------------------:|:--------------------:|:----------------------:|
| **Basic** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Basic+** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Pro** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Pro+** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

<Warning>
**Important pricing information:**
- Locations and models are paid for separately by the client (on top of package prices)
- All staff should be aware of this pricing structure
- The project manager coordinates with the client for shoot dates and logistics regarding getting the product to Oase
</Warning>

## Step 1: Check the form and assets

Before you start designing, check whether the client has completely filled out the form and provided all required assets.

<Warning>
**Important:** If assets are still missing, do **not** proceed to step 2. First contact the client to ensure there is enough material to work with.
</Warning>

### Contact the client

Always contact the client using your own business `...@oasecreative.nl` email address. The client's contact information is always in the completed form.

### Required assets checklist

Make sure you have received the following materials:

- **Logo files** - Logo files as vectors (e.g., .svg, .ai, or .eps files)
- **Photography/lifestyle assets** - Good photography/lifestyle assets provided by the client in high quality
- **Product information** - All USPs, benefits, and specifications of the product in question
- **Packaging material** - Any packaging as .PDF to create a mock-up and incorporate into the listing

<Tip>
If photography needs to be cut out, you can do this in the Slack channel **#1-photography-and-editing**.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Start designing

Once the form is complete and all assets are present, you can begin designing the listing.

### Notify the team

Update team members in the appropriate Slack channel that you have started the design.

### Photoshop setup

**Format settings:**
- Use a **3000x3000px** format for the listing

**Optimize work session:**
- Open multiple artboards in Photoshop
- Make sure you have enough storage and working memory available
- Keep the completed form and all assets close at hand while creating the listing

<Warning>
**File management:**
- Save the file periodically with the correct filename
- Also save this in the correct folder with the correct folder name on Oase Google Drive
- Keep all assets organized in case the file ever needs to be transferred
</Warning>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
**Example client request:** "Photoshop the logo onto the products" - make sure this is executed correctly.
</Note>

## Step 3: Present first version

Once the first version is ready, it can be presented to the client.

### File format for revision

If you save images for a client to present for revision:

- Make sure you stay **under 10MB per image**
- Otherwise make the format smaller, for example **2500x2500px**

### Upload and notify team

1. Upload the first version in the appropriate Slack channel
2. Update team members that the first version is ready for feedback

## Step 4: Process revisions

### Receive revisions

If the client has revisions, make sure they are followed precisely.

- **Revisions received:** When revisions are received, update team members in the appropriate Slack channel that you are working on the revisions
- **Questions about revisions:** If there are questions, contact the client via your own business `...@oasecreative.nl` email address

### No revisions

If there are no revisions, this means the assignment is complete. Update team members in the appropriate Slack channel that the assignment has been completed.

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Organization is key:** A good folder/layer structure in Photoshop ensures:
- Clear overview of the file
- Fast and efficient work
- Easy revisions
- Simple handover to colleagues
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Always contact:** Always use your own business `...@oasecreative.nl` email address for communication with clients.
